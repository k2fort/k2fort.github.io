The weapon should now be a bit more competent in PVP, without tipping the scales too much. Data shows that this weapon is still the highest performing PVE weapon at its rarity (Not counting the Hullcracker). The durability should also feel more in line with our other assault rifles.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Durability Burn Rate has been reduced from ~0.43% to ~0.17% per shot</li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"2\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">In practice, it used to take about 12 full magazines to fully deplete durability, but now it takes 26 (also accounting for the increased magazine size).</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Base Magazine Size has been increased from 20 to 22</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Base Reload Time has been reduced from 5 to 4.5</li></ul><h4>Rattler</h4><p><strong>Dev note:</strong> Even though the Rattler isn't intended to compete with the Stitcher or Kettle at close ranges, it is receiving a minor buff to bring its PVP TTK at lower levels a bit closer to the Stitcher and Kettle. The weapon should remain in its intended role as a more deliberate weapon where players are expected to dip in and out of cover, fire in controlled bursts, and manage their reloads.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Base Magazine Size has been increased from 10 to 12</li></ul><h3>ARC:</h3><h4>Shredder</h4><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Reduced the amount of knockback applied by weapons. Increased movement speed and turning responsiveness.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Increased health of the Shredder's head to prevent cases where its head could be shot off, leading to unintended behavior.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Improved Shredder navigation to reduce getting stuck on corners, narrow spaces, and short obstacles.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Increased the speed at which the Shredder enters combat when taking damage and when in close proximity to players.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Increased the number of parts on the Shredder that can be individually destroyed.</li></ul><hr><h2>Content and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2><h3>Achievements</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Achievements are now enabled in the Epic store.</li></ul><h3>Animation&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where picking up a Field Crate with a Trigger ’Nade attached could cause the character to slide or move without input.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Fixed an issue where combining Snap Hook with ziplines or ladders could store momentum and propel the player long distances.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue where the running animation could appear incorrect after a small drop when over-encumbered.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Interactions now end correctly when performing a dodge roll.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Interacting while holding items or deployables no longer causes arm twisting.&nbsp;</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Added more animations to character skins and equipment to make them more natural.</li></ul><h3>ARC</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where deployables attached to enemies could cause them to launch or clip out of bounds when shot.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Missiles no longer reverse course after passing a target and can correctly track targets at different elevations.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\"><strong>Sentinel</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed a bug where the Sentinel laser did not reach the targeted player over greater distances.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\"><strong>Surveyor</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"5\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Disabled vaulting onto ARC Surveyors to prevent unintended launches when they are moving.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed an issue where Bombardier projectiles could shoot through the Matriarch shield from the outside.</li></ul><h3>Audio&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where Gas, Stun, and Impulse Mines did not play their trigger sound or switch their light to yellow when triggered by being shot.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Increased the number of simultaneous footstep sounds and increased their priority.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue where footsteps in metal stairs became very quiet when walking slowly.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Improved directional sound for ARC enemies.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Added sounds for sending and receiving text chat messages in the main menu.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Removed the unsettling \"mom?\" from Speranza cantina ambient sound.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"7\">Tweaked the loudness of announcements in various Main Menu screens.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"8\">Number of small audio bugfixes and polish.</li></ul><h3>Maps&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue with spawning logic which could cause players who were reconnecting at the start of a session to spawn next to other players who had just joined.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Various collision, geometry, VFX and texture fixes that address gaps in terrain which made players fall through the map or walk inside geometry, stuck spots, camera clipping through walls, see-through geometry, floating objects, texture overlaps, etc.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue with the slope of the Raider Hatch that was too steep for downed raiders to crawl on top of it.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Security Lockers are now dynamically spawned across all maps instead of being statically placed.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed Raider Caches not spawning during Prospecting Probes in some cases.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Fixed lootable containers and Supply Drops spawning inside terrain on The Dam and Blue Gate, ensuring they are accessible.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"7\">Fixed an issue where doors could appear closed for some players despite being open.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"8\">Electromagnetic Storm: Lightning strikes sometimes leave behind a valuable item.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"9\">Increased the number of possible Great Mullein spawn locations across all maps.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"10\"><strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"11\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Moved the Matriarch's spawn point in Dam Battlegrounds to an area that better plays to her strengths.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"11\"><strong>Spaceport</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"12\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Adjusted the locked room protection area in Container Storage on Spaceport to not affect players outside the room.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"12\"><strong>Blue Gate</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"13\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Locked Gate map condition has been added.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Adjusted map bounds near a ledge in Blue Gate to improve navigation and reduce abrupt out-of-bounds stops.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Improved tree LODs in Blue Gate to reduce overly dark visuals at distance.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Fixed the issue where loot would spawn outside the Locked Room in the Village.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Added props and visual cues to the final camp in the quest ‘A First Foothold’ to make objective locations easier to find.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"13\"><strong>Stella Montis</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"14\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Increased some item and blueprint spawn rates in Stella Montis.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Some breachable containers on Stella Montis no longer drop Rubber Ducks when using the A Little Extra skill (sorry).</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Adjusted window glass clarity in Stella Montis to improve visibility.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">General crash fixes (including AMD crashes).</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Added Skill Tree Reset functionality in exchange for Coins, 2,000 Coins per skill point.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Wallet now shows your Cred soft cap (800).</li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Dev note: We decided to implement a cap so that players won’t be able to fully unlock new Raider Decks by accumulating Cred and added more items to Shani’s store to purchase using Cred. We believe that the Raider Decks offer a rewarding experience to enjoy while players engage with the game, and a large Cred wallet undermines this goal. We will not be removing Cred that has been accumulated before the introduction of the soft cap.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Added Raider Tool customization.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed a bug that caused players to spawn on servers without their gear and in default customization resulting in losing loadout items.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">For ranks up to Daredevil I, leaderboards now have a 3x promotion zone for the top 5 players.

Also fixed an issue where the first equip could trigger an unintended unequip.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Added notifications in Character Customization to highlight recently unlocked items.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue where equipment customization items bought from the Loadout screen were not equipped after pressing Equip on the purchase screen.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\"><strong>End of round</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"7\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Further reduced the frequency of the end of round feedback survey pop up.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Added an optional Round Feedback button on the final end-of-round screen to open a short post-match survey.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"7\"><strong>Expedition Project</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"8\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Added a show/hide tooltip hint to the Raider Projects screens (Expedition and Seasonal).</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Added 'Expeditions Completed' to Player Stats.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Added resource tracking for Expedition stages: Raider Projects now display required amounts and progress, with the tracker updating during rounds.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Added reward display to Raider Projects, showing the rewards for each goal and at Expedition completion.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed an input conflict in Raider Projects where tracking a resource in Expeditions could also open the About Expeditions window; the on-screen prompt is now hidden while adding to Load Caravan.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"8\"><strong>Inventory</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"9\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where closing the right-click menu in the inventory could reset focus to a different slot when using a gamepad.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Fixed flickering in the inventory tooltip.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Opening the inventory during a breach now cancels the interaction to prevent a brief animation glitch.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Adjusted the inventory screen layout to prevent tooltips from appearing immediately upon opening.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed an issue where the weapon slot right-click menu in the inventory would not appear after navigating from an empty attachment slot with a controller.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"9\"><strong>In-game</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"10\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where the climb prompt would not appear on a rooftop ladder in Blue Gate.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Resolved an issue where certain interaction icons could fail to appear during gameplay.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed \"revived\" events not being counted.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Fixed an issue where the zipline interaction prompt could remain on a previously used zipline, preventing interaction with a new one; prompts now clear when out of range.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Quick equip item wheel now has a stable layout and no longer collapses items towards the top when there are empty slots in the inventory.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Updated in-game text across multiple languages based on localization review and player survey feedback.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"7\">Added a cancel prompt when preparing to throw grenades and other throwable items.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"8\">Fixed in-game input hints to match your current key bindings and show clear hold/toggle labels.

We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Increased Weight from 2 to 5.</li></ul><h4>Explosive Damage</h4><p><strong>Dev note:</strong> We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.</li></ul><hr><h2>Content and Bug Fixes</h2><h3>ARC</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed a bug where

stuck on corners when moving toward the player.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Audio&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.</li></ul><h3>Maps&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\"><strong>The Dam Battlegrounds</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"3\"><ul

Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100% guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Store Cosmetic Prices</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">We have heard your feedback.&nbsp;<strong>We’ve reviewed our prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable. Revised prices will go live tomorrow, Thursday the 13th, at 10:30 CET.</strong>&nbsp;For any Raider who has already made a purchase on the old pricing, we’ll compensate you for the difference. These Raider Tokens will be refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Raider Decks</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">At the moment, we have one free Raider Deck available for all players.
