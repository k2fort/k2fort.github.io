Flocks of birds have been spotted around Buried City, gathering around chimneys for what many assume to be nefarious reasons. And to top it all off, maverick Raiders have been spotted hunting ARC for sport, and single-handedly taking on entire squads.</p><hr><h2>What’s New?</h2><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\"><strong>Solo vs Squads</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"2\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the \"Solo vs Squad\" toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\"><strong>Trophy Display</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"3\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">A new long-term project which requires players to hunt increasingly dangerous groups of ARC to submit their parts for rewards. Raiders will be able to build a new Display Case over 5 different steps (same as for the Candleberry Project) and each level will add a new item to the Display Case.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">The rewards for completing each step include blueprints as well as Raider Tokens, and full completion also brings additional rewards including a Howl emote, a guitar and 300,000 Coins. There is currently no fixed end date and it will not be impacted by Expedition resets.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\"><strong>Bird City</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Flocks of birds have moved into Buried City, building nests in the empty chimneys. We got some reports of them storing shiny trinkets inside so make sure to inspect them. This new permanent map condition will be applied to the Buried City map only which will cycle in and out of rotation weekly. There will be more bird traps and ziplines present on the map. Raiders can expect more combat in, on, or around the rooftops, including more flying ARC, and more players in proximity.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\"><strong>New Items</strong></li><li

This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li></ul><p>See you Topside,<br>//Ossen</p></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">",

unlock new Raider Decks by accumulating Cred and added more items to Shani’s store to purchase using Cred.

We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Increased Weight from 2 to 5.</li></ul><h4>Explosive Damage</h4><p><strong>Dev note:</strong> We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.</li></ul><hr><h2>Content and Bug Fixes</h2><h3>ARC</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Shredder</li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"3\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Shredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Shredder movement and handling updated: slightly reduced turn speed, improved braking, stiffer suspension, and more consistent reactions to impacts for steadier behavior in combat.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Audio&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.</li></ul><h3>Maps&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\"><strong>The Dam Battlegrounds</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"3\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\"><strong>Spaceport</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Added collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\"><strong>Blue Gate</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"5\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets;

Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100% guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Store Cosmetic Prices</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">We have heard your feedback.&nbsp;<strong>We’ve reviewed our prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable. Revised prices will go live tomorrow, Thursday the 13th, at 10:30 CET.</strong>&nbsp;For any Raider who has already made a purchase on the old pricing, we’ll compensate you for the difference. These Raider Tokens will be refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Raider Decks</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">At the moment, we have one free Raider Deck available for all players. In the future you’ll see both free and premium Raider Decks. Important things to note:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Gameplay Items are only in free Raider Decks.</strong>&nbsp;To help you along the way as a new Raider, we have included some Gameplay Items in the free Raider Deck, which can be unlocked via progression.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>There are no Pay to Win items in the premium Raider Decks.</strong>&nbsp;The focus for premium Decks are based on cosmetics and convenience.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">For more details on what’s to come for ARC Raiders, be sure to check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"/news/2025-roadmap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Roadmap</a>. We will continue to build and adjust the game with you in mind, so thank you for your feedback!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The ARC Raiders team</strong></p></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">",
