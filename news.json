    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">Hello! I'm SprinkleMountain, the weapons guy, and one of the Combat Designers here on ARC Raiders.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Since Technical Test 2 (TT2) we\u2019ve been hard at work preparing for launch. We\u2019re adding new content, sharpening what\u2019s already there, and making sure the encounters you\u2019ll get into are as thrilling, fair, and gratifying as they can be. That means a lot of balancing work based on the mountains of data and feedback we gained from so many people joining, playing, and pushing the boundaries of the game! If you played TT2, keep an eye on your email, as we\u2019re planning on sending out additional surveys in small batches to dig even deeper into your experiences and hopes!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">One of our many learnings from TT2 was that a few weapons and gadgets were bending the rules in ways that didn\u2019t align with our design intent, either by making fights too quick, too one-sided, or just not giving players the time or tools to respond. And by the rules, I mean our combat pillars, the guiding principles that shape how ARC Raiders should feel when you engage with man or machine while Topside.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Our combat is built on beats and flow.</strong>&nbsp;That means letting action ramp up and have room to breathe, not just explode and end in an instant. We want to linger in those moments where two players feel locked in, reading each other\u2019s actions and responding with their own. So, when weapons like the Arpeggio and Tempest had such a fast cadence and short TTK, those moments didn\u2019t have a chance to happen. We\u2019re tuning them to restore that flow.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>We\u2019re also thinking hard about range and versatility.</strong>&nbsp;Your loadout should influence how you move through the world, which fights you take, and how you win them. Even though the Anvil is a personal favorite of mine, it was performing a bit too well at long ranges to the point where it started cannibalizing on our rifles. Similarly, we found that our shotguns were overshadowing our SMGs. We want shotguns to feel viable, maybe more than they typically are in PvP games, but we overshot. The Vulcano hit too hard, too fast, and from too far away. So we\u2019re reworking its base cadence, spread, and how damage falls off over distance while still leaving room for you to mod it to act like the beast that it was.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">And yes. You were right. The Heavy Shields were way too strong, and shield swapping was way too efficient.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We\u2019ve got even more we\u2019re excited to show you at launch! New tools, new toys, new experiences: we\u2019re planning content that will hopefully meet your expectations and give you even more to build and bring along on your missions to the surface.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">While October might feel far away for you, for me it\u2019s a race against time to make sure we give you an experience worth the wait!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Thank you for being on this journey with us!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">SprinkleMountain</p>"

    "link": "https://arcraiders.com/news/risk-and-reward-blog",
    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">ARC Raiders is, at its core, a game about taking risks. Balancing Risk and Reward, or what we call&nbsp;<em>High Stakes</em>, is standard practice in game design, but it finds its peak in the Rust Belt. It\u2019s the cornerstone of our gameplay mechanics, and those high stakes influence everything from the items you bring with you, the noises you make, the fights you pick, and the places you dare to go. The dangers you face, and the choices you make to overcome them, should always feel worth the rewards they yield.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In a session of ARC Raiders, the clearest way we communicate risk is through the map screen. It highlights areas where you can expect to run into a greater ARC threat either through numbers or type, but have high concentrations of valuable loot. Players naturally gravitate toward these hotspots, often leading to encounters with other Raiders.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">From data in TT2, we could see that these high-risk areas were doing their job. They drew in more traffic, provided the best loot opportunities, and generated more player collisions. We did find some discrepancies that are being improved on now, like locked rooms that didn\u2019t provide enough value for the rarity of their keys and the difficulty of getting into them. We also saw high-risk areas which had great loot without a matching ARC presence. We\u2019re adjusting ARC spawns to give players a suitable challenge if they get there first.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The data also revealed unexpected hotspots, places we didn\u2019t intend to be frequented by players. We\u2019re investigating what drew players to those areas to find out what made them so interesting. Rather than trying to remove those points of interest, we\u2019re working on applying additional level design to enhance and embellish them as worthwhile areas to play in!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">An example of something we utilize when trying to analyze and understand player behavior are heatmaps, like the one pictured below which shows player movement activity in the Dam for the duration of TT2. Tools like these help us determine where the majority of the activity took place and enable us to balance the risk and reward of each area appropriately.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">This is just one of the ways we can use a heatmap. For example, comparing this to heatmaps of ARC behavior, can help us determine places where the threat is too high or too low. We also maintain heatmaps for spawns, deaths, loot actions, ARC Spawns, ARC Deaths, PvP damage, PvE damage, extraction starts, successes and failures, and so much more. As we continue on our journey toward launch, insights like these are vital in making sure we ship the best possible version of ARC Raiders.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/e88f393a-48c6-dam_heatmap-1024x1053.jpg\" alt=\"Dam Battlegrounds heatmap\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1053\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">Another high stakes situation in every trip Topside is how to find your way back to Speranza. It\u2019s time to extract and once again, you\u2019ll turn to the map. Our main extraction points have no direct cost to use, but they draw a lot of attention from both ARC and other players. The longer you stay in a session, the number of available extractions steadily diminishes. Ultimately, it's up to the player to decide whether to chase more rewards at the cost of fewer and riskier ways out, or to escape safely with lighter bags.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Of course, there is another way to extract: Raider Hatches. Hatches require Hatch Keys, which must be purchased, crafted, or found. The cost of using hatches means we can make them relatively quiet, quick, and place them in areas with less foot-traffic. From data in TT2, we saw that these hatches were a very popular choice. In fact, high-level players used hatches a whopping&nbsp;<strong>40% of the time.</strong>&nbsp;This is far more often than intended.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Hatches, while safer, are also just more&nbsp;<strong>boring</strong>&nbsp;to use and they provide a 3 for 1 deal when extracting with a squad. We want heart rates to go&nbsp;<strong>up</strong>&nbsp;when trying to extract, and that can\u2019t happen when you can always quietly drop into a hole in the ground. This means we need to rethink how Hatch Keys are acquired and make sure that using one is a choice that needs to be carefully weighed, not something you can rely on for every extraction.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Leading up to launch, we\u2019ll continue to refine and balance extractions, loot areas, spawn locations, drone compositions, and the many other things that one can encounter Topside. A well-balanced mix of Risk and Reward is at the core of the heart-pounding experience we plan to deliver with ARC Raiders. Every decision you make and every second you spend outside of Speranza should feel important, because each one could seal your fate.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">\u2013The ARC Raiders Dev Team</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/3eff3ab4-b430-extraction_points-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Various extraction points\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div>"

Here\u2019s an update from the team on what to expect when it comes to lodging:</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">As every experienced Raider knows, the abandoned wilderness of the Rust Belt is vast and unforgiving. Missions Topside are necessary, but even the tireless Raider needs a place to lay their bruised head - and all their souvenirs - after a long day of gunning down ARC.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Enter, the Raider Den.</strong>&nbsp;Shani will be kind enough to lend you a cozy bedroom to call your own. Well, \u201ccozy\u201d might be stretching it. \u201cBedroom,\u201d too. When you arrive, you\u2019ll be greeted by a metal cot, peeling decorations, and a door frame with a notable lack of door. But hey, it\u2019s better than living Topside!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Fortunately, you won\u2019t have to live in squalor forever.</strong>&nbsp;As you progress through ARC Raiders, your Den will progress with you. As players ourselves, we know how rewarding it is for you to visually see the progress your Raider is making, and the loot they\u2019re accumulating, so our intention with the Den is to do just that. Trinkets you find Topside will litter the floors and the shelves of your den. Your best guns will be proudly displayed on the walls.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The Raider Den screen will be a living representation of your progress.</strong>&nbsp;Your highest-value items will be proudly displayed on your shelves. (Even if the most valuable thing you own at the moment is fifteen rubber ducks.) Think of the Den as a bird\u2019s nest for all your trinkets, old world oddities, guns, and fancy weapon attachments.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We plan to continue refining the Den. We\u2019ll also try to get some of those mystery stains off the walls before you get here\u2026</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/a37b00dd-45a6-raider-den-640x360.gif\" alt=\"A Raider in the Raider Den\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" style=\"--image-width:640px\"></div>"

    "title": "THE SOUNDSCAPES OF ARC RAIDERS",

    "summary": "Hello again Raiders!...",
    "link": "https://arcraiders.com/news/soundscapes-blog",
    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\"><em>Hello again Raiders!</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">At Embark, we know that sound is paramount to game design. It creates immersion. It forces cohesion. It is one of the best tools we have for transporting you to a different world. That\u2019s why, from the very beginning of our journey with ARC Raiders, we intended to create an environment that you could understand even with your eyes closed, simply by listening.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">But what does it mean to understand an environment through listening? Well, it starts with familiarity. Sounds you hear in your everyday life. The hiss of a speeding train, the clicking of helicopter blades, the metronomic thumping of an engine.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>To capture these sounds accurately, the majority of what you hear in our game comes from live recordings.</strong>&nbsp;The beauty of live recordings is their ability to provide nuance of sound from a variety of angles and distances. For example, when the Audio Team at Embark records the firing of a gun, we attach a microphone to that gun, and then a microphone hundreds of meters away from that gun, and one in between those two. The same goes for explosions and projectiles. When things sound plausible and grounded, you start to believe all the unbelievable things that are happening around you.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>However, the real magic starts when we combine our live recordings with procedural game logic.</strong>&nbsp;Like every department at Embark, our Audio Team is a lean operation. We\u2019ve developed processes that allow us to craft a soundscape via dynamic game systems so we can remain small but mighty. How does that work in practice? Well, if there\u2019s a tree, you\u2019ll hear the chirping of birds. If you\u2019re standing by a car and it\u2019s raining, you\u2019ll hear droplets bouncing off of metal. At higher altitudes, the wind changes. If you\u2019re by a pond, you may hear the ribbeting of a toad. We have hundreds of these rules and parameters that decide every sound you hear.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Sound adds depth to gameplay.</strong>&nbsp;As you might have already experienced, each ARC machine has its own unique sound pattern. These sounds change depending on its state, whether the ARC is searching for something, is in combat, or just rolling around and minding its own business. We want players to be able to make strategic gameplay decisions before they ever see an ARC creep around the corner.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>If you can\u2019t tell already, we\u2019re kind of detail obsessed.</strong>&nbsp;Every single item in the game has its own foley-recorded sound effect when you grab it from your inventory, and its own voice line when pinged. We track how far apart your legs are when you\u2019re walking\u2026yes, seriously. We call it the&nbsp;<em>knee distance delta</em>. Your backpack changes sound based on how full it is.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Our audio team\u2019s philosophy is simple.</strong>&nbsp;No sound should ever take you out of the experience. Everything is recorded on the same microphones. No sound effect is sacred. If it doesn\u2019t fit, it doesn\u2019t stay. What remains is a soundscape built with intention. When we launch on October 30, we hope you\u2019ll step in and feel like you belong in the world of ARC Raiders.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">\u2013The ARC Raiders Dev Team</p><div class=\"youtube-embed_video__gEd21\" data-youtube-embed=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f64D7Kpbmcc\" title=\"ARC Raiders | Soundscapes\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>"

    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\"><em>Hey, Raiders!</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In Speranza, everyone has an agenda and the Traders are no different. They\u2019ll send you Topside on missions in exchange for rewards, slowly revealing more about who they are and what they want for Speranza\u2019s future. It\u2019s best to get to know them well, so let\u2019s start out with an introduction:</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">LANCE</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Lance is one of the most talented medics Toledo has on offer. An eccentric, bubbly android, Lance is always trying his best to fit in amongst the humans, regularly singing off-pitch at midnight karaoke, shopping for the newest underground fashion trends, or boxing in Speranza\u2019s fight ring. While amnesia has robbed him of his memories from who he was before he arrived, those trapped memories won\u2019t stay gone forever.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/18ec2c91-3167-ArcRaiders_Trader_Lance-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">APOLLO</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Speranza isn\u2019t Apollo\u2019s first rodeo. A traveling mechanic, Apollo has chosen Speranza as his home for the time being, fixing up whatever Raiders need fixing. While he can at times seem cryptic about his past, Apollo can\u2019t help but try and make wherever he is a better place. Whether that\u2019s running a kids\u2019 football team, or keeping the library stocked with books, Apollo knows there\u2019s more to life than just survival.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/12dc951c-ed5c-ArcRaiders_Trader_Apollo-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">TIAN WEN</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Most people underground haven\u2019t seen more of Tian Wen than her eyes. Speranza\u2019s resident gun craftsman, Tian Wen is a recluse who seemingly prefers the company of her tools to any human being. She wears her disdain for most Raiders on her sleeve, and only interacts with them out of her own interests. But while she would never admit it, she has a soft spot or two for things in need of repair \u2014 action figures, weapons, and sometimes even people.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/f95659d2-95f9-ArcRaiders_Trader_TianWen-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">SHANI</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">The eagle-eyed head of security for Speranza, Shani has contingency plans for her contingency plans. She is Speranza\u2019s resident ARC expert, and Celeste\u2019s biggest resource when it comes to planning successful skirmishes topside. While most of Speranza\u2019s inhabitants know her to be obsessive, suspicious, and paranoid, Shani doesn\u2019t mind her reputation as long as she\u2019s able to keep her city safe.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8178d01e-043a-ArcRaiders_Trader_Shani-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">CELESTE</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">A charismatic Raider leader in Speranza, Celeste is the ubiquitous symbol of hope for humanity in the underground. As the leader of the Raiders, she is responsible for keeping morale up, even as the ARC attacks worsen, and when tragedy comes to pass. While she tries to keep the pressure off, you can find her staying up strategizing into the wee hours of the night, furiously playing darts by the bar, and drinking coffee all day to keep her eyes open.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/9dbd6ce1-3057-ArcRaiders_Trader_Celeste-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div>"

    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">Hello all,</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">I am Virgil, the design director for ARC Raiders. I\u2019d like to spend a bit of time talking about a topic that is important to many players familiar with games like ARC. This being the subject of progression wipes, or as we refer to it, the Expedition Project.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Previously, the question of how we will handle resets or wipes has come up. Until now, the answer has been that \u201ccurrently we do not intend to do mandatory wipes.\u201d These words were chosen carefully, as we don\u2019t intend to have mandatory wipes. However, as some have guessed, we do have a voluntary reset mechanic.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we\u2019d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/1ea19ba1-e0f9-ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Expedition Project</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Which brings us to the Expedition Project. The tunnel networks connected to Speranza are vast but largely unexplored or inaccessible. Most survivors stay within their settlements, but like the Raiders who dare venture topside, there are those who dare venture even farther. Once the Rust Belt has given all it can offer, some Raiders choose to set out beyond the borders of what they know. As of now, this has always been a one-way trip.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In the full game, players will have access to a feature called \u201cProjects\u201d. At level 20, the first major project players will have access to is the Expedition Project. Upon completion, this project makes a character reset available. If a player completes a reset, they will be able to do so again so long as they complete another of these projects.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/3b2d560d-a6cb-ARCRaiders_TimelineGraphic_22_JPEG-1024x288.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"288\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">The Expedition Project will operate on a repeating cycle of roughly 8 weeks. During the course of these 8 weeks, players can contribute toward and make progress on their Expedition Project, which will overall be a somewhat large time investment. At the start of the 8th week, the ability to finalize the project will become available &amp; will remain available for that entire week. If a player has fulfilled all of the necessary stages of the project, they will be able to commit to completing the Expedition during this period.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Should a player\u2019s project not be ready during the window to complete the Expedition project, their progress will be kept, allowing them to continue working on the project until the next finalization window.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Other projects may be added over time as part of updates, holidays, and other events. These will range in scale and reward structure.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">What is kept, what is lost?</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">So, what do you keep through an Expedition vs. what is lost?</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Players will lose anything inherent to their character\u2019s progress. Levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Players will keep cosmetics (earned or purchased), awards, achievements, rankings, etc. Essentially anything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">For convenience, after completing an Expedition players will be able to skip the majority of the onboarding and tutorial steps they went through as a new player. This being things like unlocking certain features, maps, etc. as they play through the early game. These will just be available from the start of a fresh reset.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Now, aside from players who like the thrill of starting fresh, why would you willingly give up all of your hard-earned progress? Incentives.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Benefits and incentives</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">We are still finalizing the exact benefits and rewards, but they will generally follow along these lines:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\">Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\">Unique cosmetic rewards for each completed Expedition</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\">Account \u201cbuffs\u201d that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle</li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"text-align:left;list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</li></ul></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">One point to drive home is that we are being very careful about the nature of these benefits. Completing a reset should never give a player a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Initially, these benefits will center around cosmetics &amp; bragging rights, quality-of-life, and smoothing out some aspects of progression for those who have gone through a reset.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">What comes next?</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">While any and all of this is subject to change between now, launch, and post-launch, that is about the shape of it right now. We hope that by making the reset mechanic voluntary &amp; properly incentivized we can observe two results.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">1. Players who are highly engaged can experience the game fresh on a regular cadence while accruing some benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">2. Players who have less time to dedicate to the game don\u2019t have their progress reset outside of their control.They are always able to keep moving forward and at their own pace if they so choose.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">It\u2019s not a silver bullet, and won\u2019t achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Of course, this is a complex topic, so we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and follow up as necessary.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Thank you all for your interest in and passion for ARC Raiders. I look forward to seeing you Topside.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">- Virgil</p>"

    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">Hello there, I\u2019m Aleksander Gr\u00f8ndal, the Executive Producer for ARC Raiders and today I want to discuss everything you need to know about what\u2019s in the game.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">ARC Raiders is a multiplayer extraction adventure, set in a lethal future earth, ravaged by a mysterious mechanized threat known as ARC. Enlist as a Raider and scavenge the surface to thrive in a desolate world. But beware of the machines. Beware of Raiders preying on others.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In short, you\u2019ll build a name for yourself in Speranza by taking on quests, improving your gear with treasures scavenged from the dangerous world above, and making it back alive. Come back with your pack full or pass out on the surface and return empty handed. Each trip above will weigh risk with reward, and every decision you make comes with a consequence. Let\u2019s dive into some more detail:</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Topside</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Topside is the place where you spend most of your time in ARC Raiders looking for valuable loot. This could be gameplay items you can use to your advantage or items you can bring back to craft with. More of that later.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The first thing you have to be aware of is you are not alone up there, ARC machines will be looking for you.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The&nbsp;<strong>ARC</strong>&nbsp;come in many different shapes and sizes, but be aware, they are all significant threats to any Raider. You will face the small 8 legged spider looking machine called&nbsp;<strong>Ticks</strong>. These are small and stealthy creatures that live inside structures that tend to cling to roofs and walls and will jump and attack any unaware Raider.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The Snitch</strong>&nbsp;can be seen in the air looking for suspicious activity, and if they spot a Raider out in the open they will call in reinforcements. Make sure to stay hidden or take them out quick.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We also have larger machines like the&nbsp;<strong>Leaper</strong>, who patrols outside and poses massive threat with its destructive leap attack.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Or the&nbsp;<strong>Bombardier</strong>&nbsp;who with the help of Spotter drones will seek Raiders out and target designate for a lethal mortar attack.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are more ARC, like ground based Pop, Fireball, and Bastion &amp; flying ARCs like Wasps, Hornets, and Rocketeers. Each with their specific strengths and weaknesses which offer unique challenges.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/4b747273-fe36-Arc Raiders_Blog-ARCQueen_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are even larger machines, as large as an apartment building roaming the surface at times. The&nbsp;<strong>Queen</strong>&nbsp;is furiously defending the Harvester, a structure with unknown purpose. Taking on the Queen will most likely lead to a quick defeat, but for a seasoned Raider there\u2019s always a way. There are even rumors of other large variants too\u2026</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">ARC is by far not the only threat topside, there are other Raiders up there, as well. Maybe you can make a friend or two, but watch your back as other Raiders are competing for the same loot. You can choose to go alone or as a squad of up to 3 players, all viable in different ways.The matchmaking will prioritize Squad vs. Squads and Solos vs. Solos.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8e647bee-524d-Arc Raiders_Blog-RaiderObserving_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">The Rust Belt</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">All topside ventures take place in different locations around the Rust Belt. Your first location will be&nbsp;<strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong>, a map that offers forests, swamps, old research centers and apartment buildings. It\u2019s a good place to learn the ropes and many places to explore.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">After a while you will also visit&nbsp;<strong>Buried City</strong>, a pre collapse city now covered in sand dunes. Here you will explore Hospital, Mall, Town Squares, Apartment buildings and old architecture.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The Spaceport</strong>&nbsp;is a derelict launch facility filled with old technology across different industrial locations.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The Raiders have also found their way to the&nbsp;<strong>Blue Gate</strong>, a location higher up in the mountains featuring open areas, small towns, tunnels, and underground complexes to name a few.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/954163f4-963e-Arc Raiders_Blog-Environments_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are even rumors of a place called&nbsp;<strong>Stella Montis</strong>, but what that is and how to get there is still unknown\u2026</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">All locations feature different weather and times of day, and on top of that at times a location might have&nbsp;<strong>special conditions</strong>&nbsp;applied. These are events that take place on a map that changes how this map is played and what rewards it offers. Some of these are called Night Raids that take place at night (duh), where the loot is better and the threat of ARC is higher. Other conditions are Harvest Season that offers higher yield of nature loot, or Electromagnetic Storm, Hidden Bunkers etc. to name a few. The Rust belt is a place of constant change and offers all kinds of challenges.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/523cbda2-5a92-Arc Raiders_Blog-NightRaids_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Speranza - Home</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Due to the ARC threat on the surface, humans have created a new living in the relative safety below the surface. It\u2019s here Raiders come home to after visits topside. Here you can perform various different actions and build your own personal home below.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8a5bbb11-e3c9-Arc Raiders_Blog-Speranza_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">Performing various actions topside grants your Raider experience points (XP) and when you reach certain thresholds your Raiders level increases. For each level the Raider is also awarded&nbsp;<strong>skill points</strong>&nbsp;that you can spend to learn new skills and abilities. There are a plethora of choices here, so you will be able to configure your Raider to your personal preference. A more mobile Raider, more stealthy? Carry more? The choice is yours.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Topside there are also&nbsp;<strong>Feats</strong>&nbsp;to complete, these are small objectives like destroy 5 Wasps etc. that upon completion grants your Raider&nbsp;<strong>Cred</strong>. These Cred can then be spent to unlock rewards in&nbsp;<strong>Raider Decks</strong>. These are essentially different pages with rewards, and as you unlock rewards new pages become available. There will be both free and paid Raider Decks over time, and while most of them are permanent, some are time limited as well.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">There is also the&nbsp;<strong>Codex</strong>, this is a growing repository of your Raider\u2019s accumulated knowledge about ARC, the people and places in the Rust Belt. The more you progress, the more entries you will unlock.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Your&nbsp;<strong>Workshop</strong>&nbsp;is where you will be able to upgrade, craft and repair your gear and weapons. Your workshop itself can be upgraded too and as you progress you will be able to craft more and better gear.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/03e0aa56-d31b-Arc Raiders_Blog-TraderWorkshop_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">The&nbsp;<strong>Traders</strong>&nbsp;of Speranza are central figures in the community, and as you will find out - they often have different agendas. They will send you on quests that will tell the story of the Rust Belt and reward you for your help. The Traders will also trade you items and buy items you do not need.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are also&nbsp;<strong>Trials</strong>&nbsp;to complete every week, these are harder challenges that come in multiple difficulty levels, and if you perform well you will be ranked on Speranza's Raider leaderboards. Every week, new Masteries and rewards will be available.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">You will also do larger&nbsp;<strong>Projects</strong>&nbsp;in Speranza, and Virgil outlined the details of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/news/expedition-project\">Expedition project here</a>.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Preparations</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Ready to go topside? You can customise your Raider and make the Raider you want to be.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">You can customise your raider with different Faces, Face Styles, Hair Styles and Body type. Additionally you can choose cosmetics that come with a wide array of color options and detail toggles that let you define your style. No Raider is complete without a Backpack, so you will have options there as well as backpack attachment and charm.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Additional cosmetics can be unlocked by completing quests, leveling up, being unlocked in Raider Decks or be purchased in the in-game store.</p><div class=\"youtube-embed_video__gEd21\" data-youtube-embed=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dfKrKmgLB8\" title=\"Arc Raiders | Customization blog\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">Looking dapper certainly helps, but looks alone will not be able to carry you through the dangers topside. You need some good weapons and gear as well.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Customize your Raider to fit your playstyle with a plethora of&nbsp;<strong>Weapons</strong>, everything from the Rattler a simple automatic rifle, to Vulcano - a close range shotgun, to more high tech weapons like energy weapons like the Equalizer and more. There is a lot to choose from here, and you can further specialize your weapons by adding attachments or taking them to your workshop for full on upgrade.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/14a3a132-603e-Arc Raiders_Blog-Weapons_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Gadgets</strong>&nbsp;are useful tools topside and you can equip your Raider with everything from Lure Grenade to trick the ARCs, to ziplines, mines, door blockers, grenades, flares, bandage, etc the list goes on. You can also find some of these gadgets topside, but in most cases you are better off coming topside prepared.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The&nbsp;<strong>Shield and Augments</strong>&nbsp;are two items that further allow you to customise your playstyle. Do you want to be fast and light and sacrifice carry capacity? Or perhaps you want to maximise your offensive capacity for more gadgets and ammo? Maybe heavy shields are your thing?</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Being a Raider means that sometimes you run low on items. Thankfully there are ways to get back on your feet. First, there are&nbsp;<strong>Free Loadouts</strong>, these are a set of items given to you by the citizens of Speranza to help you on your way - feel free to use whenever, no strings attached. Secondly there is your trusty rooster friend&nbsp;<strong>Scrappy</strong>&nbsp;that has a very nice habit of collecting items for you. Thank him by training him or give him some nice cosmetics too!</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/0cbb6222-5656-Arc Raiders_Blog-CowboyScrappy_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">So, are you ready to become a Raider? The Rust Belt awaits, full of challenges, treasures, and untold stories. Whether you choose to brave it solo or forge alliances, ARC Raiders offers a dynamic and evolving experience we hope you will all enjoy!</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Pre-order rewards</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">To celebrate the Server Slam we have added an additional pre-order reward, The Bruiser Bundle, for all players who purchase any edition of ARC Raiders ahead of launch.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/e32826f1-bfb2-Arc Raiders_Blog-BruiserBundle_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">All pre-orders receive:</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\">The Bruiser Bundle, including Bruised Face Style, Punch Hands Emote, and Boxing Gloves Backpack</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\">Attachment The Lucky Duck Bundle, including the Hatchling Backpack and Golden Rubber Duck Backpack Charm</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>You can pre-order ARC Raiders on your favorite platform&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"/#purchase\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">See you topside soon Raider!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Best of luck, Aleks</p>"

All blueprints can be found, but those of the highest-tier will not be craftable during the Server Slam.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>Raider Deck:</strong>&nbsp;You\u2019ll be able to test out the Raider Deck functionality with one page of items to unlock.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Workshop:</strong>&nbsp;Basic crafting stations (Weapon, Equipment, and Medical) are available, but upgrades aren\u2019t possible for this limited test.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">Some systems will be visible in the world, but not yet active:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Projects (Expeditions):</strong>&nbsp;Long-term missions where a Raider leaves the Rust Belt permanently. Some progress resets, but key rewards and benefits carry over. For more information you can read&nbsp;<a href=\"/news/expedition-project\">this blogpost</a>&nbsp;from Design Director Virgil Watkins.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Trials:</strong>&nbsp;A proving ground for seasoned Raiders. Complete the challenge, return safely to Speranza, and vie for a place on the leaderboard. You\u2019ll have to wait for launch to climb ranks and earn seasonal rewards.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>Codex:</strong>&nbsp;A growing archive of your Raider\u2019s accumulated knowledge. Here you will collect stories, people, and places as you progress deeper into the world.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">It's important to note that all progress made during the Server Slam including any cosmetics or character level&nbsp;<strong>will not carry over</strong>&nbsp;to launch. However, those who participate will receive the&nbsp;<strong>Server Slammer Backpack</strong>&nbsp;that can be obtained on launch! (you must connect the Embark ID account you played with for Server Slam).</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Feats, Cred, and Raider Decks</h3><p style=\"text-align:left\">Topside, Raiders can complete small, moment-to-moment challenges called&nbsp;<strong>Feats</strong>. You\u2019ll receive a list of rotating daily tasks, asking you to destroy ARC, extract with rare loot, or other requirements. Completing these Feats will earn you&nbsp;<strong>Cred</strong>, a currency used to unlock rewards through the&nbsp;<strong>Raider Decks</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Raider Decks</strong>&nbsp;are made up of multiple pages of rewards that open as you progress. Some decks are free, others are premium, and while most stay in circulation, a few are time-limited. Be aware that you won\u2019t be able to purchase any in-game benefits.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/2ebf6fae-89fe-ArcRaiders_ServerSlam_Arc-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">The ARC machines</h3><p style=\"text-align:left\">The Rust Belt is crawling with machines that don\u2019t care who you are or how many fights you\u2019ve survived. Each one hunts differently. They are known as ARC.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Here are a few you\u2019ll face:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Wasps:</strong>&nbsp;swarming fliers, firing with accuracy</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Ticks:</strong>&nbsp;small scuttlers in the dark, waiting for you to come close</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>Bastions:</strong>&nbsp;slow-moving tanks that annihilate anything in their sight</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Leapers:</strong>&nbsp;agile jumpers that will close the gap before you can react</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">Their sounds might give them away. Listen closely for a low hum, a metallic skitter, the warning whine of a weapon spinning up. Use that knowledge to survive.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Survival tips for new Raiders</h2><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Plan your loadout.</strong>&nbsp;Bring the tools suited for the mission, not everything you own.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Breaching is loud.</strong>&nbsp;You may get loot, but it also calls attention from ARC and other Raiders.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>Stay alert.</strong>&nbsp;Extraction points disappear over time. The longer you stay, the greater the risk.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Be smart.</strong>&nbsp;Know when to extract, or you might just lose it all.</li></ul><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/5f04be78-0743-ArcRaiders_ServerSlam_ServerSlammer-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Rewards</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Play during the Server Slam and confirm your&nbsp;<strong>Embark ID</strong>&nbsp;to earn an&nbsp;<strong>exclusive backpack</strong>: The Server Slammer!

    "fullContent": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">To all the brave&nbsp;<strong>Raiders</strong>&nbsp;who joined us for the&nbsp;<strong>ARC Raiders Server Slam</strong>&nbsp;this past weekend: from the entire team, thank you. Your participation was absolutely vital.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We designed the Server Slam to stress-test our systems and collect real-world feedback, and you delivered. We are working around the clock to implement fixes and tune the game for launch.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">The Key Takeaways</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Your feedback, coupled with our data, gave us crucial insights, and we took immediate action on several fronts:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Stability:</strong>&nbsp;You helped us quickly identify and resolve&nbsp;<strong>stability issues</strong>&nbsp;across all platforms during the test. We\u2019ve locked in even more solutions leading up to launch day to ensure a smooth launch experience.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>The Flying ARCs:</strong>&nbsp;It turns out their&nbsp;<strong>awareness was a bit too high</strong>, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we\u2019ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>The Dam Tower:</strong>&nbsp;We watched many of you bravely, and perhaps a little too easily, access the Dam Control Tower on Dam Battlegrounds. It was fun to watch, but a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That\u2019s been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Visual Difference:</strong>&nbsp;Some noticed a visual difference between Server Slam and earlier tests on certain hardware. The default settings did change a bit to favor more performance, and we are looking into tuning further to strike the right balance.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">Beyond these points, your reports helped us squash a number of bugs and helped identify and address game balance and suggested improvements to the experience. Every piece of data and feedback you provided is helping us to make&nbsp;<em>ARC Raiders</em>&nbsp;a better game. Here is a look at some community stats over the course of the Server Slam test.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8dffc394-49af-ArcRaiders_KeyArt_SlamInfographic-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">We\u2019re spending these final days putting the finishing touches on the game to prepare for our&nbsp;<strong>full launch on October 30th</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">See you topside again soon!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Aleks &amp; The ARC Raiders Team</p>"

These Raider Tokens will be refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Raider Decks</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">At the moment, we have one free Raider Deck available for all players.

Through experimentation, new technologies, and a laser focus on carving out a unique space in the extraction genre, ARC Raiders was born - we want to show you that journey.&nbsp;</p><p>In our upcoming three-part series, documentary filmmaker Danny O'Dwyer explores the making of ARC Raiders: from initial sketches that sparked a world of climate collapse and malevolent machines, through the painful reset in 2021, and finally to the extraction adventure that millions of Raiders play today.</p><h2>The documentary:</h2><p>This series dives into some of the pivotal moments in ARC Raiders' development, including:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdorU3sjt_0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EPISODE 1</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Finding ARC Raiders - from six developers chatting in an apartment to the very first designs, gameplay mechanics, and ARC enemies.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_fD5NL_pg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EPISODE 2</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The Life of a Raider - pivoting to a PvPvE framework with a focus on building immersive worlds, realistic sound design, and a satisfying gameplay loop.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRlhpzc7ImA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EPISODE 3</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Building ARC Machines - pioneering new approaches to machine learning to build intelligent and cunning enemies, each with distinct attributes and threats.</p><p>Throughout these three episodes, you'll get to know some of the key players in ARC Raiders' development including the creative and art director, devs and designers, and our very own sound wizard!&nbsp;</p><p>For now, we'll leave you with a taste of episode one - the full version will be available November 21st, with episode two dropping a week later.</p><div class=\"youtube-embed_video__gEd21\" data-youtube-embed=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_nO2RVFoyQ\" title=\"The Evolution of ARC Raiders EP1 - Teaser\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div><p>With love,<br>The ARC Raiders Team</p>"

Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was H\u0227kan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p><p><strong>H\u0227kan was unlike the other roosters.</strong> Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p><p>One day, I decided to photoscan H\u00e5kan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of H\u0227kan sprinting around the cantina.</p><p><strong>But then, H\u0227kan</strong> <strong>got his chance to shine. </strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a \u201cresource producer,\u201d something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p><p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats\u2026 robot-cats! But the art team didn\u2019t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, \u201cdon\u2019t we have a rooster?\u201d</p><p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon. </strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to \u201ctemporary mesh we\u2019ll definitely replace later\u201d, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p><p>Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got to go and find 12 mushrooms.</p>"

Maybe it\u2019s the thrill of danger, the feel of fresh air on your skin, or the promise of wealth that\u2019s only available Topside.</p><p>Whatever <em>your </em>reason, all Raiders share one thing in common: the spirit of adventure.</p><h2>The Expedition Project</h2><p>The Expedition hit a minor delay, and the window will now open on <strong>17th December.</strong> You will have a six-day period in which your Raider can choose to leave The Rust Belt for good. By departing in the Caravan you have constructed in the Expedition Project, you will restart your journey with certain buffs and advantages. We want to take you through some of these here.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/1ea19ba1-e0f9-ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2>So, you\u2019re leaving Speranza?</h2><p>When the Expedition departs, all items in your Raider\u2019s stash will be contributed toward it. Your next Raider can <strong>earn up to five skill points</strong> based on the total value of your Stash and Coins at the time of departure. <strong>One million Coins worth of value equals one extra skill point for your new Raider.</strong></p><p>When you restart, everything tied to your progress will be reset. This means your Skill Tree, Level, Stash, Workshop, Crafting Abilities, and Blueprints. It\u2019s worth noting that the initial onboarding from your first deployment in Speranza will be skipped - that means all maps and potential workshop upgrades will be available as soon as you reset.</p><p>Your new Raider won\u2019t totally restart at square one. By resetting, you will unlock the following advantages and rewards:</p><h4>Permanent Unlocks:</h4><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">The Patchwork Raider outfit</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Scrappy Janitor Cap</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Expeditions Indicator icon</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Skill points (depending on Stash value)</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">+12 Stash space</li></ul><h4>Temporary Buffs:</h4><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">10% repair buff</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">5% xp boost</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">6% more materials from Scrappy</li></ul><p>While Skill Points, extra Stash space, and cosmetics are permanent unlocks, the<strong> account buffs will expire if you choose not to depart with the subsequent expedition</strong>. Bear in mind, <strong>buffs will increase in power</strong> for your next three expeditions (but only one departure allowed per Expedition Window!).</p><p>Remember, the Expedition Window will be open from <strong>17th December and last until 22nd December.</strong> You must sign up during this period, and everyone automatically departs at the same time on the 22nd.</p><p>The value of your Stash and Coins will be counted when the window closes - so don\u2019t stop looting before then. If you choose not to depart this time around, don\u2019t worry - your progress toward building a Caravan will be preserved, so you can keep working on it until the next window opens in a couple of months.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/3b2d560d-a6cb-ARCRaiders_TimelineGraphic_22_JPEG-1024x288.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"288\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2>Why are we doing it like this?&nbsp;</h2><p>Progression wipes are a notoriously difficult thing to balance in online multiplayer games - we get that. Mandatory global wipes have some obvious benefits: heavily invested players get to re-experience the initial grind once again and, for a time, the playing field is levelled.&nbsp;</p><p>The optional Expedition Project is our solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes - specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game. We want to offer you the choice:</p><p><strong>Not completed as much as you\u2019d like?</strong> Keep on raiding, building, and growing<strong>. Ready for a new challenge and to grind once again? </strong>Depart on the Expedition, and receive buffs, rewards, and bragging rights.</p><p>For now, the story is yours to write - we can\u2019t wait to see what you decide!</p><p>With love,<br>The ARC Raiders Team</p>"

The weapon should now be a bit more competent in PVP, without tipping the scales too much. Data shows that this weapon is still the highest performing PVE weapon at its rarity (Not counting the Hullcracker). The durability should also feel more in line with our other assault rifles.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Durability Burn Rate has been reduced from ~0.43% to ~0.17% per shot</li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"2\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">In practice, it used to take about 12 full magazines to fully deplete durability, but now it takes 26 (also accounting for the increased magazine size).</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Base Magazine Size has been increased from 20 to 22</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Base Reload Time has been reduced from 5 to 4.5</li></ul><h4>Rattler</h4><p><strong>Dev note:</strong> Even though the Rattler isn't intended to compete with the Stitcher or Kettle at close ranges, it is receiving a minor buff to bring its PVP TTK at lower levels a bit closer to the Stitcher and Kettle. The weapon should remain in its intended role as a more deliberate weapon where players are expected to dip in and out of cover, fire in controlled bursts, and manage their reloads.</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Base Magazine Size has been increased from 10 to 12</li></ul><h3>ARC:</h3><h4>Shredder</h4><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Reduced the amount of knockback applied by weapons. Increased movement speed and turning responsiveness.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Increased health of the Shredder's head to prevent cases where its head could be shot off, leading to unintended behavior.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Improved Shredder navigation to reduce getting stuck on corners, narrow spaces, and short obstacles.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Increased the speed at which the Shredder enters combat when taking damage and when in close proximity to players.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Increased the number of parts on the Shredder that can be individually destroyed.</li></ul><hr><h2>Content and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2><h3>Achievements</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Achievements are now enabled in the Epic

class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue where the running animation could appear incorrect after a small drop when over-encumbered.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Interactions now end correctly when performing a dodge roll.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Interacting while holding items or deployables no longer causes arm twisting.&nbsp;</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Added more animations to character skins and equipment to make them more natural.</li></ul><h3>ARC</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue where deployables attached to enemies could cause them to launch or clip out of bounds when shot.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Missiles no longer reverse course after passing a target and can correctly track targets at different elevations.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\"><strong>Sentinel</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed a bug where the Sentinel laser did not reach the targeted player over greater distances.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\"><strong>Surveyor</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"5\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Disabled vaulting onto ARC Surveyors to prevent unintended launches when they are

messages in the main menu.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Removed the unsettling \"mom?\" from Speranza cantina ambient sound.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"7\">Tweaked the loudness of announcements in various Main Menu screens.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"8\">Number of small audio bugfixes and polish.</li></ul><h3>Maps&nbsp;</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Fixed an issue with spawning logic which could cause players who were reconnecting at the start of a session to spawn next to other players who had just joined.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Various collision, geometry, VFX and texture fixes that address gaps in terrain which made players fall through the map or walk inside geometry, stuck spots, camera clipping through walls, see-through geometry, floating objects, texture overlaps, etc.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Fixed an issue with the slope of the Raider Hatch that was too steep for downed raiders to crawl on top of it.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Security Lockers are now dynamically spawned across all maps instead of being statically placed.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed Raider Caches not spawning during Prospecting Probes in some cases.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">Fixed lootable containers and Supply Drops spawning inside terrain on The Dam and Blue Gate, ensuring they are accessible.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"7\">Fixed an issue where doors could appear closed for some players despite being open.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"8\">Electromagnetic Storm: Lightning strikes sometimes leave behind a

plays to her strengths.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"11\"><strong>Spaceport</strong></li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"12\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Adjusted the locked room protection area in Container Storage on Spaceport to not affect players outside the room.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"12\"><strong>Blue

class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"14\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Increased some item and blueprint spawn rates in Stella Montis.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Some breachable containers on Stella Montis no longer drop Rubber Ducks when using the A Little Extra skill (sorry).</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Adjusted window glass clarity

class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">Dev note: We decided to implement a cap so that players won\u2019t be able to fully unlock new Raider Decks by accumulating Cred and added more items to Shani\u2019s store to purchase using Cred. We believe that the Raider Decks offer a rewarding experience to enjoy while players engage with the game, and a large Cred wallet undermines this goal. We will not be removing Cred that has been accumulated before the introduction of the soft cap.</li></ul></li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Added Raider Tool customization.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">Fixed a bug that caused players to spawn on servers without their gear and in default customization resulting in losing loadout items.</li><li class=\"\" value=\"6\">For ranks up to Daredevil I, leaderboards now have a 3x promotion zone for the top 5 players.
