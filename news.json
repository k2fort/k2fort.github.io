Time to embrace the cold, build up your stamina skill points to sprint further, and don’t forget to stock up on those all-essential bandages.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>“The bushes can usually be found around smaller structures, in addition to around rocky areas and other foliage.”</em><br><strong>Marika Ohlsson, World &amp; Level Designer</strong></p><p>There’s also a rumour going round that some who venture Topside have even been lucky enough to find a Candleberry stash or two that an unlucky Raider has left behind..</p><p>So what are you waiting for, Raider?&nbsp; There’s an old saying from the beforetimes, ‘there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes’. So put on your warmest gear and get up there.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay warm.

Maybe it’s the thrill of danger, the feel of fresh air on your skin, or the promise of wealth that’s only available Topside.</p><p>Whatever <em>your </em>reason, all Raiders share one thing in common: the spirit of adventure.</p><h2>The Expedition Project</h2><p>The Expedition hit a minor delay, and the window will now open on <strong>17th December.</strong> You will have a six-day period in which your Raider can choose to leave The Rust Belt for good. By departing in the Caravan you have constructed in the Expedition Project, you will restart your journey with certain buffs and advantages. We want to take you through some of these here.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/1ea19ba1-e0f9-ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2>So, you’re leaving Speranza?</h2><p>When the Expedition departs, all items in your Raider’s stash will be contributed toward it. Your next Raider can <strong>earn up to five skill points</strong> based on the total value of your Stash and Coins at the time of departure. <strong>One million Coins worth of value equals one extra skill point for your new Raider.</strong></p><p>When you restart, everything tied to your progress will be reset. This means your Skill Tree, Level, Stash, Workshop, Crafting Abilities, and Blueprints. It’s worth noting that the initial onboarding from your first deployment in Speranza will be skipped - that means all maps and potential workshop upgrades will be available as soon as you reset.</p><p>Your new Raider won’t totally restart at square one. By resetting, you will unlock the following advantages and rewards:</p><h4>Permanent Unlocks:</h4><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">The Patchwork Raider outfit</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">Scrappy Janitor Cap</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">Expeditions Indicator icon</li><li class=\"\" value=\"4\">Skill points (depending on Stash value)</li><li class=\"\" value=\"5\">+12 Stash space</li></ul><h4>Temporary Buffs:</h4><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">10% repair buff</li><li class=\"\" value=\"2\">5% xp boost</li><li class=\"\" value=\"3\">6% more materials from Scrappy</li></ul><p>While Skill Points, extra Stash space, and cosmetics are permanent unlocks, the<strong> account buffs will expire if you choose not to depart with the subsequent expedition</strong>. Bear in mind, <strong>buffs will increase in power</strong> for your next three expeditions (but only one departure allowed per Expedition Window!).</p><p>Remember, the Expedition Window will be open from <strong>17th December and last until 22nd December.</strong> You must sign up during this period, and everyone automatically departs at the same time on the 22nd.</p><p>The value of your Stash and Coins will be counted when the window closes - so don’t stop looting before then. If you choose not to depart this time around, don’t worry - your progress toward building a Caravan will be preserved, so you can keep working on it until the next window opens in a couple of months.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/3b2d560d-a6cb-ARCRaiders_TimelineGraphic_22_JPEG-1024x288.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"288\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2>Why are we doing it like this?&nbsp;</h2><p>Progression wipes are a notoriously difficult thing to balance in online multiplayer games - we get that. Mandatory global wipes have some obvious benefits: heavily invested players get to re-experience the initial grind once again and, for a time, the playing field is levelled.&nbsp;</p><p>The optional Expedition Project is our solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes - specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game. We want to offer you the choice:</p><p><strong>Not completed as much as you’d like?</strong> Keep on raiding, building, and growing<strong>. Ready for a new challenge and to grind once again? </strong>Depart on the Expedition, and receive buffs, rewards, and bragging rights.</p><p>For now, the story is yours to write - we can’t wait to see what you decide!</p><p>With love,<br>The ARC Raiders Team</p></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p><p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong> Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p><p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p><p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong> <strong>got his chance to shine. </strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p><p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p><p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon. </strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p><p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go and find 12 mushrooms.</p></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

If you hit a snag, we’re dedicated to getting it ironed out as soon as we can.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We cannot wait to see how you fare topside, what daring raids you undertake, what formidable ARC threats you overcome, and what friends or enemies you meet. The team and I are more than excited we are on this journey together.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Now jump in, gear up and venture topside. The Rust Belt awaits!</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Aleks and the ARC Raiders team</p><div class=\"youtube-embed_video__gEd21\" data-youtube-embed=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpeJjQDXNAE\" title=\"Launch Trailer | ARC Raiders\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

Your participation was absolutely vital.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We designed the Server Slam to stress-test our systems and collect real-world feedback, and you delivered. We are working around the clock to implement fixes and tune the game for launch.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">The Key Takeaways</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Your feedback, coupled with our data, gave us crucial insights, and we took immediate action on several fronts:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Stability:</strong>&nbsp;You helped us quickly identify and resolve&nbsp;<strong>stability issues</strong>&nbsp;across all platforms during the test. We’ve locked in even more solutions leading up to launch day to ensure a smooth launch experience.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>The Flying ARCs:</strong>&nbsp;It turns out their&nbsp;<strong>awareness was a bit too high</strong>, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>The Dam Tower:</strong>&nbsp;We watched many of you bravely, and perhaps a little too easily, access the Dam Control Tower on Dam Battlegrounds. It was fun to watch, but a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That’s been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Visual Difference:</strong>&nbsp;Some noticed a visual difference between Server Slam and earlier tests on certain hardware. The default settings did change a bit to favor more performance, and we are looking into tuning further to strike the right balance.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">Beyond these points, your reports helped us squash a number of bugs and helped identify and address game balance and suggested improvements to the experience. Every piece of data and feedback you provided is helping us to make&nbsp;<em>ARC Raiders</em>&nbsp;a better game. Here is a look at some community stats over the course of the Server Slam test.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8dffc394-49af-ArcRaiders_KeyArt_SlamInfographic-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">We’re spending these final days putting the finishing touches on the game to prepare for our&nbsp;<strong>full launch on October 30th</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">See you topside again soon!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Aleks &amp; The ARC Raiders Team</p></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

They’ll send you on quests that tell the story of the Rust Belt and reward you for your help. You’ll trade with them, sell what you don’t need, and earn their trust one job at a time.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">During the Server Slam, Traders will offer&nbsp;<strong>a selection of early quests</strong>. The more advanced work will have to wait until launch.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/70c10a5d-0d0c-ArcRaiders_ServerSlam_Scavenging-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Server Slam content</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Weapons and Gear:</strong>&nbsp;Early and mid-tier equipment will be available for you to experiment with, but some things will be locked until launch.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Blueprints:</strong>&nbsp;Blueprints expand your Raider’s ability to make and modify weapons and gear.

Some progress resets, but key rewards and benefits carry over. For more information you can read&nbsp;<a href=\"/news/expedition-project\">this blogpost</a>&nbsp;from Design Director Virgil Watkins.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Trials:</strong>&nbsp;A proving ground for seasoned Raiders.

Here you will collect stories, people, and places as you progress deeper into the world.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">It's important to note that all progress made during the Server Slam including any cosmetics or character level&nbsp;<strong>will not carry over</strong>&nbsp;to launch. However, those who participate will receive the&nbsp;<strong>Server Slammer Backpack</strong>&nbsp;that can be obtained on launch! (you must connect the Embark ID account you played with for Server Slam).</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Feats, Cred, and Raider Decks</h3><p style=\"text-align:left\">Topside, Raiders can complete small, moment-to-moment challenges called&nbsp;<strong>Feats</strong>. You’ll receive a list of rotating daily tasks, asking you to destroy ARC, extract with rare loot, or other requirements. Completing these Feats will earn you&nbsp;<strong>Cred</strong>, a currency used to unlock rewards through the&nbsp;<strong>Raider Decks</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Raider Decks</strong>&nbsp;are made up of multiple pages of rewards that open as you progress. Some decks are free, others are premium, and while most stay in circulation, a few are time-limited. Be aware that you won’t be able to purchase any in-game benefits.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/2ebf6fae-89fe-ArcRaiders_ServerSlam_Arc-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">The ARC machines</h3><p style=\"text-align:left\">The Rust Belt is crawling with machines that don’t care who you are or how many fights you’ve survived. Each one hunts differently. They are known as ARC.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Here are a few you’ll face:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Wasps:</strong>&nbsp;swarming fliers, firing with accuracy</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Ticks:</strong>&nbsp;small scuttlers in the dark, waiting for you to come close</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>Bastions:</strong>&nbsp;slow-moving tanks that annihilate anything in their sight</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Leapers:</strong>&nbsp;agile jumpers that will close the gap before you can react</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">Their sounds might give them away. Listen closely for a low hum, a metallic skitter, the warning whine of a weapon spinning up. Use that knowledge to survive.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Survival tips for new Raiders</h2><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\"><strong>Plan your loadout.</strong>&nbsp;Bring the tools suited for the mission, not everything you own.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\"><strong>Breaching is loud.</strong>&nbsp;You may get loot, but it also calls attention from ARC and other Raiders.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\"><strong>Stay alert.</strong>&nbsp;Extraction points disappear over time. The longer you stay, the greater the risk.</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"4\"><strong>Be smart.</strong>&nbsp;Know when to extract, or you might just lose it all.</li></ul><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/5f04be78-0743-ArcRaiders_ServerSlam_ServerSlammer-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Rewards</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Play during the Server Slam and confirm your&nbsp;<strong>Embark ID</strong>&nbsp;to earn an&nbsp;<strong>exclusive backpack</strong>: The Server Slammer!

Enlist as a Raider and scavenge the surface to thrive in a desolate world. But beware of the machines. Beware of Raiders preying on others.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In short, you’ll build a name for yourself in Speranza by taking on quests, improving your gear with treasures scavenged from the dangerous world above, and making it back alive. Come back with your pack full or pass out on the surface and return empty handed. Each trip above will weigh risk with reward, and every decision you make comes with a consequence. Let’s dive into some more detail:</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Topside</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Topside is the place where you spend most of your time in ARC Raiders looking for valuable loot. This could be gameplay items you can use to your advantage or items you can bring back to craft with. More of that later.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The first thing you have to be aware of is you are not alone up there, ARC machines will be looking for you.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The&nbsp;<strong>ARC</strong>&nbsp;come in many different shapes and sizes, but be aware, they are all significant threats to any Raider. You will face the small 8 legged spider looking machine called&nbsp;<strong>Ticks</strong>. These are small and stealthy creatures that live inside structures that tend to cling to roofs and walls and will jump and attack any unaware Raider.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The Snitch</strong>&nbsp;can be seen in the air looking for suspicious activity, and if they spot a Raider out in the open they will call in reinforcements. Make sure to stay hidden or take them out quick.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We also have larger machines like the&nbsp;<strong>Leaper</strong>, who patrols outside and poses massive threat with its destructive leap attack.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Or the&nbsp;<strong>Bombardier</strong>&nbsp;who with the help of Spotter drones will seek Raiders out and target designate for a lethal mortar attack.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are more ARC, like ground based Pop, Fireball, and Bastion &amp; flying ARCs like Wasps, Hornets, and Rocketeers. Each with their specific strengths and weaknesses which offer unique challenges.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/4b747273-fe36-Arc Raiders_Blog-ARCQueen_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are even larger machines, as large as an apartment building roaming the surface at times. The&nbsp;<strong>Queen</strong>&nbsp;is furiously defending the Harvester, a structure with unknown purpose. Taking on the Queen will most likely lead to a quick defeat, but for a seasoned Raider there’s always a way. There are even rumors of other large variants too…</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">ARC is by far not the only threat topside, there are other Raiders up there, as well. Maybe you can make a friend or two, but watch your back as other Raiders are competing for the same loot. You can choose to go alone or as a squad of up to 3 players, all viable in different ways.The matchmaking will prioritize Squad vs. Squads and Solos vs. Solos.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8e647bee-524d-Arc Raiders_Blog-RaiderObserving_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">The Rust Belt</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">All topside ventures take place in different locations around the Rust Belt. Your first location will be&nbsp;<strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong>, a map that offers forests, swamps, old research centers and apartment buildings. It’s a good place to learn the ropes and many places to explore.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">After a while you will also visit&nbsp;<strong>Buried City</strong>, a pre collapse city now covered in sand dunes. Here you will explore Hospital, Mall, Town Squares, Apartment buildings and old architecture.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The Spaceport</strong>&nbsp;is a derelict launch facility filled with old technology across different industrial locations.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The Raiders have also found their way to the&nbsp;<strong>Blue Gate</strong>, a location higher up in the mountains featuring open areas, small towns, tunnels, and underground complexes to name a few.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/954163f4-963e-Arc Raiders_Blog-Environments_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are even rumors of a place called&nbsp;<strong>Stella Montis</strong>, but what that is and how to get there is still unknown…</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">All locations feature different weather and times of day, and on top of that at times a location might have&nbsp;<strong>special conditions</strong>&nbsp;applied. These are events that take place on a map that changes how this map is played and what rewards it offers. Some of these are called Night Raids that take place at night (duh), where the loot is better and the threat of ARC is higher. Other conditions are Harvest Season that offers higher yield of nature loot, or Electromagnetic Storm, Hidden Bunkers etc. to name a few. The Rust belt is a place of constant change and offers all kinds of challenges.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/523cbda2-5a92-Arc Raiders_Blog-NightRaids_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Speranza - Home</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Due to the ARC threat on the surface, humans have created a new living in the relative safety below the surface. It’s here Raiders come home to after visits topside. Here you can perform various different actions and build your own personal home below.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8a5bbb11-e3c9-Arc Raiders_Blog-Speranza_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">Performing various actions topside grants your Raider experience points (XP) and when you reach certain thresholds your Raiders level increases. For each level the Raider is also awarded&nbsp;<strong>skill points</strong>&nbsp;that you can spend to learn new skills and abilities. There are a plethora of choices here, so you will be able to configure your Raider to your personal preference. A more mobile Raider, more stealthy? Carry more? The choice is yours.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Topside there are also&nbsp;<strong>Feats</strong>&nbsp;to complete, these are small objectives like destroy 5 Wasps etc. that upon completion grants your Raider&nbsp;<strong>Cred</strong>. These Cred can then be spent to unlock rewards in&nbsp;<strong>Raider Decks</strong>. These are essentially different pages with rewards, and as you unlock rewards new pages become available. There will be both free and paid Raider Decks over time, and while most of them are permanent, some are time limited as well.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">There is also the&nbsp;<strong>Codex</strong>, this is a growing repository of your Raider’s accumulated knowledge about ARC, the people and places in the Rust Belt. The more you progress, the more entries you will unlock.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Your&nbsp;<strong>Workshop</strong>&nbsp;is where you will be able to upgrade, craft and repair your gear and weapons. Your workshop itself can be upgraded too and as you progress you will be able to craft more and better gear.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/03e0aa56-d31b-Arc Raiders_Blog-TraderWorkshop_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">The&nbsp;<strong>Traders</strong>&nbsp;of Speranza are central figures in the community, and as you will find out - they often have different agendas. They will send you on quests that will tell the story of the Rust Belt and reward you for your help. The Traders will also trade you items and buy items you do not need.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">There are also&nbsp;<strong>Trials</strong>&nbsp;to complete every week, these are harder challenges that come in multiple difficulty levels, and if you perform well you will be ranked on Speranza's Raider leaderboards. Every week, new Masteries and rewards will be available.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">You will also do larger&nbsp;<strong>Projects</strong>&nbsp;in Speranza, and Virgil outlined the details of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/news/expedition-project\">Expedition project here</a>.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Preparations</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Ready to go topside? You can customise your Raider and make the Raider you want to be.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">You can customise your raider with different Faces, Face Styles, Hair Styles and Body type. Additionally you can choose cosmetics that come with a wide array of color options and detail toggles that let you define your style. No Raider is complete without a Backpack, so you will have options there as well as backpack attachment and charm.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Additional cosmetics can be unlocked by completing quests, leveling up, being unlocked in Raider Decks or be purchased in the in-game store.</p><div class=\"youtube-embed_video__gEd21\" data-youtube-embed=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dfKrKmgLB8\" title=\"Arc Raiders | Customization blog\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">Looking dapper certainly helps, but looks alone will not be able to carry you through the dangers topside. You need some good weapons and gear as well.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Customize your Raider to fit your playstyle with a plethora of&nbsp;<strong>Weapons</strong>, everything from the Rattler a simple automatic rifle, to Vulcano - a close range shotgun, to more high tech weapons like energy weapons like the Equalizer and more. There is a lot to choose from here, and you can further specialize your weapons by adding attachments or taking them to your workshop for full on upgrade.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/14a3a132-603e-Arc Raiders_Blog-Weapons_16-9-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Gadgets</strong>&nbsp;are useful tools topside and you can equip your Raider with everything from Lure Grenade to trick the ARCs, to ziplines, mines, door blockers, grenades, flares, bandage, etc the list goes on. You can also find some of these gadgets topside, but in most cases you are better off coming topside prepared.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The&nbsp;<strong>Shield and Augments</strong>&nbsp;are two items that further allow you to customise your playstyle. Do you want to be fast and light and sacrifice carry capacity? Or perhaps you want to maximise your offensive capacity for more gadgets and ammo? Maybe heavy shields are your thing?</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Being a Raider means that sometimes you run low on items. Thankfully there are ways to get back on your feet. First, there are&nbsp;<strong>Free Loadouts</strong>, these are a set of items given to you by the citizens of Speranza to help you on your way - feel free to use whenever, no strings attached. Secondly there is your trusty rooster friend&nbsp;<strong>Scrappy</strong>&nbsp;that has a very nice habit of collecting items for you.

    "fullContent": "<div class=\"news-article-page_header___YvCu\"><div class=\"news-article-page_titleAndTags__ZiEj3\"><div class=\"news-article-page_tags__aObgO\"></div><h1 class=\"news-article-page_title__oCpmA\">Expedition Project</h1></div><div>October 9, 2025</div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"article_article__Do3j2\"><div class=\"payload-richtext\"><p style=\"text-align:left\">Hello all,</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">I am Virgil, the design director for ARC Raiders. I’d like to spend a bit of time talking about a topic that is important to many players familiar with games like ARC. This being the subject of progression wipes, or as we refer to it, the Expedition Project.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Previously, the question of how we will handle resets or wipes has come up. Until now, the answer has been that “currently we do not intend to do mandatory wipes.” These words were chosen carefully, as we don’t intend to have mandatory wipes. However, as some have guessed, we do have a voluntary reset mechanic.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/1ea19ba1-e0f9-ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Expedition Project</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Which brings us to the Expedition Project. The tunnel networks connected to Speranza are vast but largely unexplored or inaccessible. Most survivors stay within their settlements, but like the Raiders who dare venture topside, there are those who dare venture even farther. Once the Rust Belt has given all it can offer, some Raiders choose to set out beyond the borders of what they know. As of now, this has always been a one-way trip.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In the full game, players will have access to a feature called “Projects”. At level 20, the first major project players will have access to is the Expedition Project. Upon completion, this project makes a character reset available. If a player completes a reset, they will be able to do so again so long as they complete another of these projects.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/3b2d560d-a6cb-ARCRaiders_TimelineGraphic_22_JPEG-1024x288.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"288\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">The Expedition Project will operate on a repeating cycle of roughly 8 weeks. During the course of these 8 weeks, players can contribute toward and make progress on their Expedition Project, which will overall be a somewhat large time investment. At the start of the 8th week, the ability to finalize the project will become available &amp; will remain available for that entire week. If a player has fulfilled all of the necessary stages of the project, they will be able to commit to completing the Expedition during this period.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Should a player’s project not be ready during the window to complete the Expedition project, their progress will be kept, allowing them to continue working on the project until the next finalization window.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Other projects may be added over time as part of updates, holidays, and other events. These will range in scale and reward structure.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">What is kept, what is lost?</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">So, what do you keep through an Expedition vs. what is lost?</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Players will lose anything inherent to their character’s progress. Levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Players will keep cosmetics (earned or purchased), awards, achievements, rankings, etc. Essentially anything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">For convenience, after completing an Expedition players will be able to skip the majority of the onboarding and tutorial steps they went through as a new player. This being things like unlocking certain features, maps, etc. as they play through the early game. These will just be available from the start of a fresh reset.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Now, aside from players who like the thrill of starting fresh, why would you willingly give up all of your hard-earned progress? Incentives.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Benefits and incentives</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">We are still finalizing the exact benefits and rewards, but they will generally follow along these lines:</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"1\">Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"2\">Unique cosmetic rewards for each completed Expedition</li><li class=\"\" style=\"text-align:left\" value=\"3\">Account “buffs” that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle</li><li class=\"nestedListItem\" style=\"text-align:left;list-style-type:none\" value=\"4\"><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li class=\"\" value=\"1\">And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</li></ul></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:left\">One point to drive home is that we are being very careful about the nature of these benefits. Completing a reset should never give a player a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Initially, these benefits will center around cosmetics &amp; bragging rights, quality-of-life, and smoothing out some aspects of progression for those who have gone through a reset.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">What comes next?</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">While any and all of this is subject to change between now, launch, and post-launch, that is about the shape of it right now. We hope that by making the reset mechanic voluntary &amp; properly incentivized we can observe two results.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">1. Players who are highly engaged can experience the game fresh on a regular cadence while accruing some benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">2. Players who have less time to dedicate to the game don’t have their progress reset outside of their control.They are always able to keep moving forward and at their own pace if they so choose.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">It’s not a silver bullet, and won’t achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Of course, this is a complex topic, so we’ll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and follow up as necessary.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Thank you all for your interest in and passion for ARC Raiders. I look forward to seeing you Topside.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">- Virgil</p></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

They’ll send you Topside on missions in exchange for rewards, slowly revealing more about who they are and what they want for Speranza’s future. It’s best to get to know them well, so let’s start out with an introduction:</p><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">LANCE</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Lance is one of the most talented medics Toledo has on offer. An eccentric, bubbly android, Lance is always trying his best to fit in amongst the humans, regularly singing off-pitch at midnight karaoke, shopping for the newest underground fashion trends, or boxing in Speranza’s fight ring. While amnesia has robbed him of his memories from who he was before he arrived, those trapped memories won’t stay gone forever.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/18ec2c91-3167-ArcRaiders_Trader_Lance-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">APOLLO</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Speranza isn’t Apollo’s first rodeo. A traveling mechanic, Apollo has chosen Speranza as his home for the time being, fixing up whatever Raiders need fixing. While he can at times seem cryptic about his past, Apollo can’t help but try and make wherever he is a better place. Whether that’s running a kids’ football team, or keeping the library stocked with books, Apollo knows there’s more to life than just survival.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/12dc951c-ed5c-ArcRaiders_Trader_Apollo-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">TIAN WEN</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">Most people underground haven’t seen more of Tian Wen than her eyes. Speranza’s resident gun craftsman, Tian Wen is a recluse who seemingly prefers the company of her tools to any human being. She wears her disdain for most Raiders on her sleeve, and only interacts with them out of her own interests. But while she would never admit it, she has a soft spot or two for things in need of repair — action figures, weapons, and sometimes even people.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/f95659d2-95f9-ArcRaiders_Trader_TianWen-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">SHANI</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">The eagle-eyed head of security for Speranza, Shani has contingency plans for her contingency plans. She is Speranza’s resident ARC expert, and Celeste’s biggest resource when it comes to planning successful skirmishes topside. While most of Speranza’s inhabitants know her to be obsessive, suspicious, and paranoid, Shani doesn’t mind her reputation as long as she’s able to keep her city safe.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/8178d01e-043a-ArcRaiders_Trader_Shani-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><h2 style=\"text-align:left\">CELESTE</h2><p style=\"text-align:left\">A charismatic Raider leader in Speranza, Celeste is the ubiquitous symbol of hope for humanity in the underground. As the leader of the Raiders, she is responsible for keeping morale up, even as the ARC attacks worsen, and when tragedy comes to pass. While she tries to keep the pressure off, you can find her staying up strategizing into the wee hours of the night, furiously playing darts by the bar, and drinking coffee all day to keep her eyes open.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/9dbd6ce1-3057-ArcRaiders_Trader_Celeste-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

It creates immersion. It forces cohesion. It is one of the best tools we have for transporting you to a different world. That’s why, from the very beginning of our journey with ARC Raiders, we intended to create an environment that you could understand even with your eyes closed, simply by listening.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">But what does it mean to understand an environment through listening? Well, it starts with familiarity. Sounds you hear in your everyday life. The hiss of a speeding train, the clicking of helicopter blades, the metronomic thumping of an engine.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>To capture these sounds accurately, the majority of what you hear in our game comes from live recordings.</strong>&nbsp;The beauty of live recordings is their ability to provide nuance of sound from a variety of angles and distances. For example, when the Audio Team at Embark records the firing of a gun, we attach a microphone to that gun, and then a microphone hundreds of meters away from that gun, and one in between those two. The same goes for explosions and projectiles. When things sound plausible and grounded, you start to believe all the unbelievable things that are happening around you.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>However, the real magic starts when we combine our live recordings with procedural game logic.</strong>&nbsp;Like every department at Embark, our Audio Team is a lean operation. We’ve developed processes that allow us to craft a soundscape via dynamic game systems so we can remain small but mighty. How does that work in practice? Well, if there’s a tree, you’ll hear the chirping of birds. If you’re standing by a car and it’s raining, you’ll hear droplets bouncing off of metal. At higher altitudes, the wind changes. If you’re by a pond, you may hear the ribbeting of a toad. We have hundreds of these rules and parameters that decide every sound you hear.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Sound adds depth to gameplay.</strong>&nbsp;As you might have already experienced, each ARC machine has its own unique sound pattern. These sounds change depending on its state, whether the ARC is searching for something, is in combat, or just rolling around and minding its own business. We want players to be able to make strategic gameplay decisions before they ever see an ARC creep around the corner.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>If you can’t tell already, we’re kind of detail obsessed.</strong>&nbsp;Every single item in the game has its own foley-recorded sound effect when you grab it from your inventory, and its own voice line when pinged. We track how far apart your legs are when you’re walking…yes, seriously. We call it the&nbsp;<em>knee distance delta</em>. Your backpack changes sound based on how full it is.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Our audio team’s philosophy is simple.</strong>&nbsp;No sound should ever take you out of the experience. Everything is recorded on the same microphones. No sound effect is sacred. If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t stay. What remains is a soundscape built with intention. When we launch on October 30, we hope you’ll step in and feel like you belong in the world of ARC Raiders.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">–The ARC Raiders Dev Team</p><div class=\"youtube-embed_video__gEd21\" data-youtube-embed=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f64D7Kpbmcc\" title=\"ARC Raiders | Soundscapes\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

Here’s an update from the team on what to expect when it comes to lodging:</em></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">As every experienced Raider knows, the abandoned wilderness of the Rust Belt is vast and unforgiving. Missions Topside are necessary, but even the tireless Raider needs a place to lay their bruised head - and all their souvenirs - after a long day of gunning down ARC.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Enter, the Raider Den.</strong>&nbsp;Shani will be kind enough to lend you a cozy bedroom to call your own. Well, “cozy” might be stretching it. “Bedroom,” too. When you arrive, you’ll be greeted by a metal cot, peeling decorations, and a door frame with a notable lack of door. But hey, it’s better than living Topside!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Fortunately, you won’t have to live in squalor forever.</strong>&nbsp;As you progress through ARC Raiders, your Den will progress with you. As players ourselves, we know how rewarding it is for you to visually see the progress your Raider is making, and the loot they’re accumulating, so our intention with the Den is to do just that. Trinkets you find Topside will litter the floors and the shelves of your den. Your best guns will be proudly displayed on the walls.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>The Raider Den screen will be a living representation of your progress.</strong>&nbsp;Your highest-value items will be proudly displayed on your shelves. (Even if the most valuable thing you own at the moment is fifteen rubber ducks.) Think of the Den as a bird’s nest for all your trinkets, old world oddities, guns, and fancy weapon attachments.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We plan to continue refining the Den. We’ll also try to get some of those mystery stains off the walls before you get here…</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/a37b00dd-45a6-raider-den-640x360.gif\" alt=\"A Raider in the Raider Den\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" style=\"--image-width:640px\"></div></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

Balancing Risk and Reward, or what we call&nbsp;<em>High Stakes</em>, is standard practice in game design, but it finds its peak in the Rust Belt. It’s the cornerstone of our gameplay mechanics, and those high stakes influence everything from the items you bring with you, the noises you make, the fights you pick, and the places you dare to go. The dangers you face, and the choices you make to overcome them, should always feel worth the rewards they yield.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">In a session of ARC Raiders, the clearest way we communicate risk is through the map screen. It highlights areas where you can expect to run into a greater ARC threat either through numbers or type, but have high concentrations of valuable loot. Players naturally gravitate toward these hotspots, often leading to encounters with other Raiders.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">From data in TT2, we could see that these high-risk areas were doing their job. They drew in more traffic, provided the best loot opportunities, and generated more player collisions. We did find some discrepancies that are being improved on now, like locked rooms that didn’t provide enough value for the rarity of their keys and the difficulty of getting into them. We also saw high-risk areas which had great loot without a matching ARC presence. We’re adjusting ARC spawns to give players a suitable challenge if they get there first.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">The data also revealed unexpected hotspots, places we didn’t intend to be frequented by players. We’re investigating what drew players to those areas to find out what made them so interesting. Rather than trying to remove those points of interest, we’re working on applying additional level design to enhance and embellish them as worthwhile areas to play in!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">An example of something we utilize when trying to analyze and understand player behavior are heatmaps, like the one pictured below which shows player movement activity in the Dam for the duration of TT2. Tools like these help us determine where the majority of the activity took place and enable us to balance the risk and reward of each area appropriately.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">This is just one of the ways we can use a heatmap. For example, comparing this to heatmaps of ARC behavior, can help us determine places where the threat is too high or too low. We also maintain heatmaps for spawns, deaths, loot actions, ARC Spawns, ARC Deaths, PvP damage, PvE damage, extraction starts, successes and failures, and so much more. As we continue on our journey toward launch, insights like these are vital in making sure we ship the best possible version of ARC Raiders.</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/e88f393a-48c6-dam_heatmap-1024x1053.jpg\" alt=\"Dam Battlegrounds heatmap\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1053\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div><p style=\"text-align:left\">Another high stakes situation in every trip Topside is how to find your way back to Speranza. It’s time to extract and once again, you’ll turn to the map. Our main extraction points have no direct cost to use, but they draw a lot of attention from both ARC and other players. The longer you stay in a session, the number of available extractions steadily diminishes. Ultimately, it's up to the player to decide whether to chase more rewards at the cost of fewer and riskier ways out, or to escape safely with lighter bags.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Of course, there is another way to extract: Raider Hatches. Hatches require Hatch Keys, which must be purchased, crafted, or found. The cost of using hatches means we can make them relatively quiet, quick, and place them in areas with less foot-traffic. From data in TT2, we saw that these hatches were a very popular choice. In fact, high-level players used hatches a whopping&nbsp;<strong>40% of the time.</strong>&nbsp;This is far more often than intended.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Hatches, while safer, are also just more&nbsp;<strong>boring</strong>&nbsp;to use and they provide a 3 for 1 deal when extracting with a squad. We want heart rates to go&nbsp;<strong>up</strong>&nbsp;when trying to extract, and that can’t happen when you can always quietly drop into a hole in the ground. This means we need to rethink how Hatch Keys are acquired and make sure that using one is a choice that needs to be carefully weighed, not something you can rely on for every extraction.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Leading up to launch, we’ll continue to refine and balance extractions, loot areas, spawn locations, drone compositions, and the many other things that one can encounter Topside. A well-balanced mix of Risk and Reward is at the core of the heart-pounding experience we plan to deliver with ARC Raiders. Every decision you make and every second you spend outside of Speranza should feel important, because each one could seal your fate.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">–The ARC Raiders Dev Team</p><div><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/media/3eff3ab4-b430-extraction_points-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Various extraction points\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" style=\"--image-width:1024px\"></div></div></div><div class=\"news-article-page_divider__9qSLQ\"></div><div class=\"news-article-page_otherArticlesContainer___MwEu\"><h2 class=\"news-article-grid_readMoreArticlesCta__FerIp\">More articles:</h2><div class=\"news-article-grid_container__ItrzP\"><div class=\"news-article-grid_newsArticleGrid__pzHK6\"><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/winter-condition-dev-top-tips\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/fd1e1af8-9f7f-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/0726df4e-ee73-winter-condition-dev-top-tips-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Cold Snap - tips and tricks from the devs</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 20, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/1000-free-raider-tokens\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/a625b22b-207d-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/96d20ac0-8c75-1000-free-raider-tokens-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Thank you, Raiders!</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/hotfix-dec-18\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/temp/articles/generic-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">Hotfix - Dec 18</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 18, 2025</div></div></a><a class=\"news-article-card_container__xsniv\" href=\"/news/cold-snap-patch-notes\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/dcfa3d0c-1ee7-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x100-300x100.png\"><img class=\"news-article-card_image__s_EMS\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/web-arc-raiders-cms-assets/article-cards/8d339332-8eeb-cold-snap-patch-notes-card-300x200-300x200.png\" alt=\"Generic article card image\"></picture><div class=\"news-article-card_content__mgzb6\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tags__1Ygpc\"><div class=\"news-article-card_tag__Oa_GF\">Patch Notes</div></div><div class=\"news-article-card_title__7LpPs\">December Update 1.7.0</div><div class=\"news-article-card_date__fJqI_\">December 16, 2025</div></div></a></div><a class=\"link-button_button__qVGPE link-button_button-size-large__TCcPH link-button_button-color-light__AKgq4 link-button_button-text-default__TzawW\" href=\"/news\">See more articles</a></div></div>"

I'm SprinkleMountain, the weapons guy, and one of the Combat Designers here on ARC Raiders.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">Since Technical Test 2 (TT2) we’ve been hard at work preparing for launch. We’re adding new content, sharpening what’s already there, and making sure the encounters you’ll get into are as thrilling, fair, and gratifying as they can be. That means a lot of balancing work based on the mountains of data and feedback we gained from so many people joining, playing, and pushing the boundaries of the game! If you played TT2, keep an eye on your email, as we’re planning on sending out additional surveys in small batches to dig even deeper into your experiences and hopes!</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">One of our many learnings from TT2 was that a few weapons and gadgets were bending the rules in ways that didn’t align with our design intent, either by making fights too quick, too one-sided, or just not giving players the time or tools to respond. And by the rules, I mean our combat pillars, the guiding principles that shape how ARC Raiders should feel when you engage with man or machine while Topside.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Our combat is built on beats and flow.</strong>&nbsp;That means letting action ramp up and have room to breathe, not just explode and end in an instant. We want to linger in those moments where two players feel locked in, reading each other’s actions and responding with their own. So, when weapons like the Arpeggio and Tempest had such a fast cadence and short TTK, those moments didn’t have a chance to happen. We’re tuning them to restore that flow.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>We’re also thinking hard about range and versatility.</strong>&nbsp;Your loadout should influence how you move through the world, which fights you take, and how you win them. Even though the Anvil is a personal favorite of mine, it was performing a bit too well at long ranges to the point where it started cannibalizing on our rifles. Similarly, we found that our shotguns were overshadowing our SMGs. We want shotguns to feel viable, maybe more than they typically are in PvP games, but we overshot. The Vulcano hit too hard, too fast, and from too far away. So we’re reworking its base cadence, spread, and how damage falls off over distance while still leaving room for you to mod it to act like the beast that it was.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">And yes. You were right. The Heavy Shields were way too strong, and shield swapping was way too efficient.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">We’ve got even more we’re excited to show you at launch!
